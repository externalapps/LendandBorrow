Flow Implementation:
Direct Lending:
L selects contact B, sends offer (Lending Section → Direct Lending tab → "Create Loan")
B sees offer (Borrowing Section → Loan Offers tab → "Accept Loan")
B automatically redirects to KYC (4 steps: PAN/Aadhaar → Bank → Selfie → Video)
After KYC completion, loan is auto-accepted and L is notified
L funds the loan (Loan Detail → "Fund Loan" via Razorpay)
Borrowing:
B initiates request (Borrowing Section → Request Loan tab → "Submit Request")
B automatically redirects to KYC (same 4 steps)
After KYC, B returns to form, enters details, submits request
L sees request (Lending Section → Loan Requests tab → "Accept Request")
L funds the loan (Loan Detail → "Fund Loan" via Razorpay)
