Flow Implementation:
Direct Lending:
L selects contact B, sends offer (Lending Section → Direct Lending tab → "Create Loan")
B sees offer (Borrowing Section → Loan Offers tab → "Accept Loan")
B automatically redirects to KYC (4 steps: PAN/Aadhaar → Bank → Selfie → Video)
After KYC completion, loan is auto-accepted and L is notified
L funds the loan (Loan Detail along with CIBIL SCORE AND BORROWER CREDIT INFORMATION → "Fund Loan" via Razorpay)

Borrowing:
B initiates request (Borrowing Section → Request Loan tab → "Submit Request")
B automatically redirects to KYC (same 4 steps)
After KYC, B returns to form, enters details, submits request
L sees request (Lending Section → Loan Requests tab → "Accept Request")
L funds the loan (Loan Detail along with CIBIL SCORE AND BORROWER CREDIT INFORMATION → "Fund Loan" via Razorpay)



Borrowing Process Flow:
B initiates request → POST /requests → Creates loan with status: 'PENDING_LENDER_ACCEPT'
B auto-redirects to KYC → ✅ Working
After KYC, B submits request → ✅ Working
L sees request → GET /requests → Shows loan requests
L accepts request → POST /requests/:id/accept → Sets status: 'PENDING_PAYMENT' ✅ FIXED
L funds via Razorpay → POST /requests/:id/pay → Sets status: 'ACTIVE' ✅ FIXED
B can now repay → Repayment page with 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% buttons ✅ FIXED
Direct Lending Process Flow:
L creates loan → POST /loans → Creates loan with status: 'PENDING_BORROWER_ACCEPT'
B sees offer → ✅ Working
B accepts offer → POST /:id/accept → Sets status: 'PENDING_LENDER_FUNDING' ✅ FIXED
L funds via Razorpay → POST /:id/fund-escrow → Sets status: 'ACTIVE' ✅ FIXED
B can now repay → Repayment page with 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% buttons ✅ FIXED
✅ Both Processes Are Fixed!
Borrowing Process:
✅ Correct roles (Rajesh = Borrower, Priya = Lender)
✅ L can accept and fund the loan
✅ B gets repayment options after funding
Direct Lending Process:
✅ L can fund the loan after B accepts
✅ B gets repayment options after funding
Both flows now properly transition loans to 'ACTIVE' status after funding, which enables the repayment functionality with the 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% buttons!
