Loan Repayment & Excuse Logic – With Continuous CIBIL Reporting
Step 1: Loan Activation

Loan amount = X (example: 1000).

Platform fee = X * 1% (10).

Borrower receives X - fee (990).

Lender expects repayment of full X (1000).

Step 2: Repayment Timeline

Due Date (Day 30)

Borrower must repay full X.

If repaid → loan closed.

If not → loan enters Excuse 1.

Excuse 1 (Day 31–40)

Borrower must pay ≥ 20% of outstanding.

If paid ≥ 20% →

Platform levies 1% fee on outstanding principal.

Loan continues.

If paid < 20% →

On Day 40, CIBIL report: 30+ DPD (days past due).

Loan still continues, but borrower is marked delinquent.

Excuse 2 (Day 41–50)

Same rules as Excuse 1.

If borrower fails:

On Day 50, CIBIL report: 40+ DPD.

Excuse 3 (Day 51–60)

Same rules.

If borrower fails:

On Day 60, CIBIL report: 50+ DPD.

Excuse 4 (Day 61–70)

Same rules.

If borrower fails:

On Day 70, CIBIL report: 60+ DPD (final default).

After Day 70

If loan is not cleared → final CIBIL report as “Default” and loan closed as non-performing.

Step 3: Core Rules

Outstanding Calculation:

outstanding = original_loan - total_paid


Minimum Payment Rule:

≥ 20% of outstanding principal must be paid in each excuse window.

Excuse Fee Rule:

If ≥ 20% paid → levy 1% fee on outstanding.

If < 20% paid → report to CIBIL at end of excuse.

CIBIL Reporting:

Sent at end of each excuse period if borrower fails rule.

Reports escalate as:

Day 40 → 30+ DPD

Day 50 → 40+ DPD

Day 60 → 50+ DPD

Day 70 → 60+ DPD + Default

Step 4: Example Flow

Loan = 1000

Borrower gets 990 (after platform fee).

Day 30: No repayment. Outstanding = 1000.

Day 31–40 (Excuse 1):

Borrower pays only 100 (< 20%).

→ On Day 40 → CIBIL report “30+ DPD”.

Day 41–50 (Excuse 2):

Borrower pays nothing.

→ On Day 50 → CIBIL report “40+ DPD”.

Day 51–60 (Excuse 3):

Borrower pays 200 (≥ 20%).

→ Platform levies 1% of 800 = 8. Loan continues. No CIBIL this time.

Day 61–70 (Excuse 4):

Borrower again pays nothing.

→ On Day 70 → CIBIL report “60+ DPD + Default”.

✅ This way, the borrower always knows:

They must pay ≥ 20% each excuse window to avoid CIBIL.

Even if they fail once, CIBIL keeps updating every excuse window with worsening delinquency.

Platform earns fees: 1% upfront + 1% each excuse window (if ≥ 20% paid).

Lender always gets back exactly the principal they lent.    NOTE : Quick Action Buttons (Repayment Options in UI)

Borrower sees 4 quick repayment options:

25% of outstanding

50% of outstanding

75% of outstanding

100% of outstanding

⚠️ These buttons are repayment convenience options only.

They must not be confused with the system’s minimum payment rule (20%) for avoiding CIBIL.

Example: Borrower can choose to repay 25% (which is higher than 20%), and that satisfies the minimum requirement.
