 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
Issue 1: Platform Fee Logic is WRONG
Current Logic (INCORRECT):
Platform fee is added to ledger as a separate charge
Borrower receives full principal amount
Total repayment = Principal + Platform Fee
Correct Logic (from your specification):
Platform fee is deducted from principal BEFORE giving to borrower
Borrower receives: Principal - Platform Fee (e.g., â‚¹990 for â‚¹1000 loan)
Total repayment = Principal only (e.g., â‚¹1000)
Issue 2: Outstanding Calculation is WRONG
Current: outstanding = principal - totalPaid
Should be: outstanding = principal - principalPayments (exclude platform fees from outstanding)
Issue 3: Date Display Issues
Invalid dates showing in dashboard - likely due to missing or malformed date fields.
ðŸ”§ SOLUTION PLAN:
Should I fix these critical issues BEFORE we combine and redeploy? This will ensure:
âœ… Correct payment calculations
âœ… Proper platform fee handling
âœ… Fixed date displays
âœ… Consistent amount displays across all pages
This is CRITICAL to fix now - otherwise the combined deployment will have the same issues!
Shall I proceed with fixing these logic issues first? ðŸš€
