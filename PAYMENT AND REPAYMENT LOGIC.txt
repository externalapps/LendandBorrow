THE CORRECT LOGIC IS "LENDER PAYS AN AMOUNT, THE PLATFORM IS CALCULATED ON THAT AMOUNT AND IS DEDUCTED FROM THAT AMOUNT AND THE PLATFORM COMES TO THE PLATFORM OR OUR COMPANY'S ACCOUNT, THE REMAINING AMOUNT IS SENT TO BORROWER AND WHEN BORROWER REPAYS, IN REPAYMENT TOTAL AMOUNT TO BE PAID WILL THE EXACTLY THE AMOUNT PAID BY THE LENDER. IN THIS WAY, THE BORROWER IS OKAY TO SACRIFICE THE 1% PLATFORM FEE TO GET THE LOAN, WE DECUT THE PLATFORM FEE FIRST ONLY AND GIVE THE REMINING TO BORROWER J8UST LIKE PRIVATE LENDERS KEEP THEIR ONE MONTH INTEREST FROM THEPRINICPAL AND GIVE THE REMAINIGN TO BORROWER, WE DO SAME, FOR 1000, 1% IS 10, 10 IS SENT TO PLATFORM, 990 TO BORROWER, BUT BORROWER PAYS 1000 TO LENDER IN REPAYMENT" GOT THE LOGIC ?
